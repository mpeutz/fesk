Fesk Styleguide is based on KSS ([Knyle Stype Sheets](http://warpspire.com/kss/)). KSS a documentation syntax for stylesheets is an awesome tool but lacked some features that a living styleguide needs. Fesk takes the format that KSS started and expands on it. It includes "browser compatibility", "notes", "preproccessor mixin, function and variable documentation", "color chips" and "animations". Furthermore Fesk has implemented a change log, and simple stylesheet statistics dashboard, and versioning.


This plugin currently lacks tests.
